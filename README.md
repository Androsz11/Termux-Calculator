# Termux-Calculator
Many people has made calculators for termux/linux.
But all are external commands. You need to use either ./ or bash command to use those.
But in this program i made a simple calculator for begginers in termux.
This program is an internal command. You just have to type Calc in termux to run it.
This program can also be used in linux. I named it as Termux-Calculator as i built it in termux and specially made in termux.
